The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to build a web base game called draw it or lose it. The game was only available in the Android app and client wants to expand to all other platforms. The reach out to Creative Technology Solutions to come up with an idea on how they could expand to other platforms. 

I think what I did well is design UML diagrams. I really did enjouy the assignment of creating UML diagrams and I can see how it can help designing a software. I am always a person who wants to jump in and start solving a problem. I think creating a UML diagram can really help with a complex design. 

Like I said above what helped me the most is UML diagrams. I was able to look at the diagram and make the necessary changes and design to make it work. Sometimes I feel like I want to make a change because it makes sense but then when you take a look at the UML diagram it makes more sense why part of the design should be in a different spot. 

I would revise Rest API documentation. I feel like this project was kind of unclear on what really is needed. I can see how Rest API is a beneficial concept and I think it should be taught more in depth. I would even say it would be very beneficial to build it from the beginning. 

User needs are very important because they are the client. Sometimes you might think that you would prefer something to work differently but client is paying and it is a client's decision on how they want the software to work.

How did i approach the problems? For example the singleton pattern was very useful in this game design. This was the first time i was introduced to a concept called singleton pattern and honestly i never knew that there a multiple patterns on how software can be designed. I read the chapter, watched youtube videos and it helped me with the design for a singleton pattern.
